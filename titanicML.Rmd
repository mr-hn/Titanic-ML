###Importing the training and test data
```{R}
#Getting the CSV Data
trainUrl <- "http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/Kaggle/train.csv"
testUrl  <- "http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/Kaggle/test.csv"

#Reading into dataframes
train <- read.csv(trainUrl, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
test  <- read.csv(testUrl,  stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#Combining train and test data for later use
test$Survived <- NA
combi <- rbind(train, test)

#Viewing the data features
str(combi)
```
###Prediction based on gender and age
```{R}
#View gender's contrinution to survival
prop.table(table(train$Sex,train$Survived),1)

#Add new variable checking if passenger is child
#Considering the time, this determination takes into account one's gender
train$Child <- 0
train$Child[train$Sex == "female" & train$Age < 18] <- 1
train$Child[train$Sex == "male"   & train$Age < 16] <- 1

test$Child <- 0
test$Child[test$Sex == "female" & test$Age < 18] <- 1
test$Child[test$Sex == "male"   & test$Age < 16] <- 1

table(train$Child)

#View gender and age's contribution
aggregate(Survived ~ Child + Sex, data=train, FUN=function(x) {sum(x)/length(x)})
#As seen in aggregate, one will more likely survive if female 
#Or a male younger than 16
#Build output 
test$Survived <- 0
test$Survived[test$Sex == 'female'] <- 1
test$Survived[test$Sex == 'male' & test$Child == 1] <- 1
#View output
aggregate(Survived ~ Child + Sex, data=test, FUN=function(x) {sum(x)/length(x)})

#Take CSV
submit1 <- data.frame(PassengerId = test$PassengerId, Survived = test$Survived)
write.csv(submit1, file = "OutputsMac/submit1.csv", row.names = FALSE)
#Accuracy of 76.077%
#This can be improved by taking more factors into consideration
```
###Taking Passenger Class and Fare paid into consideration
```{R}
#New categorised variable for fare
train$FareCateg <- '30+'
train$FareCateg[train$Fare < 30 & train$Fare >= 20] <- '20-30'
train$FareCateg[train$Fare < 20 & train$Fare >= 10] <- '10-20'
train$FareCateg[train$Fare < 10] <- '<10'
aggregate(Survived ~ FareCateg + Pclass + Child + Sex, data=train, FUN=function(x) {sum(x)/length(x)})

#Females in third class, child or no are less likely to survive especially if they paid higher fare
#Male children survived unless they were in third class, paying higher fee
#Build output
test$Survived <- 0
test$Survived[test$Sex == "female"] <- 1
test$Survived[test$Sex == "female" & test$Child == 0 & test$Pclass == 3 & test$Fare > 20 ] <- 0
test$Survived[test$Sex == "female" & test$Child == 1 & test$Pclass == 3 & test$Fare > 20 ] <- 0
test$Survived[test$Sex == "male"   & test$Child == 1 ] <- 1
test$Survived[test$Sex == "male"   & test$Child == 1 & test$Pclass == 3 & test$Fare > 20] <- 0

submit2 <- data.frame(PassengerId = test$PassengerId, Survived = test$Survived)
write.csv(submit2, file = "OutputsMac/submit2.csv", row.names = FALSE)

#Accuracy of 77.99%
```
###Working with decision tree
```{R}
library(rpart)
set.seed(1804)
#Build a model based on features Class, Family Size and embarkment point, along with gender and age
tree1 <- rpart(Survived ~ Pclass + Sex + Age + SibSp + Parch + Fare + Embarked,
               data=train, method="class")
#Applying the model on test data
prediction <- predict(tree1, test, type = "class" )

#Build output for Kaggle
submit3 <- data.frame(PassengerId = test$PassengerId, Survived = prediction)
write.csv(submit3, file = "OutputsMac/submit3.csv", row.names = FALSE)

#Much improved accuracy of 78.469% since other factors are taken into account as well
```
###Feature Engineering
```{R}
#A passenger with a title is more likely to survive because of his importance
#Working on the combined data to do feature engineering on train and test
combi$Name <- as.character(combi$Name)

#Creating a new field Title, derived from passenger name
#Function that will return the second string in first line, which is the title
getTitle <- function(x){ strsplit(x, split='[,.]')[[1]][2] }
combi$Title <- sapply(combi$Name, FUN=getTitle)
#Removing the extra space
combi$Title <- sub(' ', '', combi$Title)
table(combi$Title)

#Combine less frequently appearing titles
combi$Title[combi$Title %in% c('Mme', 'Mlle')] <- 'Mlle'
combi$Title[combi$Title %in% c('Capt', 'Don', 'Major', 'Sir')] <- 'Sir'
combi$Title[combi$Title %in% c('Dona', 'Lady', 'the Countess', 'Jonkheer')] <- 'Lady'
combi$Title <- factor(combi$Title)
table(combi$Title)

#Attempt to combine families together
#FamilySize attribute holding the sum of siblings, spouse, parents, children and self
combi$FamilySize <- combi$SibSp + combi$Parch + 1

#Combine families based on their surnames
#Get their last names in to the Surname field
combi$Surname <- sapply(combi$Name, FUN=function(x) {strsplit(x, split='[,.]')[[1]][1]})
#FamilyID field, that will be a combination of last name and family size
combi$FamilyID <- paste(as.character(combi$FamilySize), combi$Surname, sep="")
#When the family is too small, they are categorised as small to reduce factors
combi$FamilyID[combi$FamilySize <= 2] <- 'Small'
#Note that this is done on train + test data and hence families across both the dataframes are categorised

#In case of mismatch, ie people in same family with different surnames, categorise them as small
famIDs <- data.frame(table(combi$FamilyID))
famIDs <- famIDs[famIDs$Freq <= 2,]
combi$FamilyID[combi$FamilyID %in% famIDs$Var1] <- 'Small'
combi$FamilyID <- factor(combi$FamilyID)

#Separating data back
train <- combi[1:891,]
test <- combi[892:1309,]

#Build the model
tree2 <- rpart(Survived ~ Pclass + Sex + Age + SibSp + Parch + Fare + Embarked + Title + FamilySize +                   FamilyID, 
               data=train, method="class")

#Predict output and build csv
prediction <- predict(tree2, test, type = "class")
submit4 <- data.frame(PassengerId = test$PassengerId, Survived = prediction)
write.csv(submit4, file = "OutputsMac/submit4.csv", row.names = FALSE)

#Far improved accuracy at 79.426%
```
###Working with random forest
```{R}
#Remove all null/NA values

#Decision tree for empty age fields
library(rpart)
summary(train$Age)
ageTree <-rpart(Age ~ Pclass + Sex + SibSp + Parch + Fare + Embarked + Title + FamilySize,
                  data=combi[!is.na(combi$Age),], method="anova")
combi$Age[is.na(combi$Age)] <- predict(ageTree, combi[is.na(combi$Age),])

#Function to get mode for Embarked where missing
getmode <- function(v) {
   uniqv <- unique(v)
   uniqv[which.max(tabulate(match(v, uniqv)))]
}
embarkedMode<-getmode(combi$Embarked)
which(combi$Embarked == "")
#Since most passengers embarked at Southampton, the same is passed for empty fields
combi$Embarked[c(62, 830)] <- embarkedMode

#Pass median fare wherever empty
which(is.na(combi$Fare))
combi$Fare[1044] <- median(combi$Fare, na.rm=TRUE)

#Applying log transformation on Fare to reduce variance
combi$Fare2 <- ifelse(combi$Fare !=0,  log10(combi$Fare), 0)

#Since familyID has too many factors, redefine "small" family size to reduce factors
combi$FamilyID2 <- combi$FamilyID
combi$FamilyID2 <- as.character(combi$FamilyID2)
combi$FamilyID2[combi$FamilySize <= 3] <- 'Small'
combi$FamilyID2 <- factor(combi$FamilyID2)

#Separating data back and factorising required fields for random forest
combi$Sex <- as.factor(combi$Sex)
combi$FamilySize <- as.factor((combi$FamilySize))
combi$Embarked <- as.factor((combi$Embarked))
train <- combi[1:891,]
test <- combi[892:1309,]
str(combi)
library(randomForest)
set.seed(1804)

#Build Random Forest model
forest <- randomForest(as.factor(Survived) ~ Pclass + Sex + Age + SibSp + Parch + Fare2 + Embarked +                            Title + FamilySize + FamilyID2,
                       data=train, importance=TRUE, ntree=2000)

#Predict results and build CSV
prediction <- predict(forest, test, type = "class")
submit5 <- data.frame(PassengerId = test$PassengerId, Survived = prediction)
write.csv(submit5, file = "OutputsMac/submit5.csv", row.names = FALSE)

#Lower accuracy at 77.033 %.
#Small test dataset, probably the better model though
```
###Forest of conditional inference trees
```{R}
library(party)
set.seed(1804)

#Build conditional interference tree
condForest <- cforest(as.factor(Survived) ~ Pclass + Sex + Age + SibSp + Parch + Fare2 + Embarked + Title                       + FamilySize + FamilyID, 
                      data = train, controls=cforest_unbiased(ntree=2000, mtry=3))

#Apply model and build output
prediction <-predict(condForest, test, OOB=TRUE, type = "response")
submit6 <- data.frame(PassengerId = test$PassengerId, Survived = prediction)
write.csv(submit6, file = "OutputsMac/submit6.csv", row.names = FALSE)

#Accuracy of 0.80861 - Top 7%
